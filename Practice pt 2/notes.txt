all 8 plant move around the same orbital plan as that of sun equatorial plane calle ecliptic plane
earth buldges at equator and flattens at poles and has an shape of oblate spheroid
polar diameter is shorter than equatorial and polar ravity is more than equatorial
purpose of geographic grid system is to find precise location
north and south pole has 90 latitude 
equator has 0
parallel latitude:because they dont meet
circles of latitude:because they go round the globe to form circle

latitude are measured north and south of equator
arctic circle 6.5
antarctic circle
tropic of cancer 
tropic of capricon
different latitudes arctic antarctica cancer capricon
low latitude 
mid latitude
high latitude
temperate 30 66.5
equator 5n 5s
tropical 23.5-23.5
subtropical 25-30
polar 66.5-90

longitude are also called meridian or midday all the places on the same longitude have the same midday
runs north to south and crosses latitude at 90
measured in angular degrress east or west of prime meridian or greenwich meridian
